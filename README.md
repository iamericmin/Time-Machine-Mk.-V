## DIY nRF52 watch with BLE

Project status: idk

# hi
This is an update of my previous project, the Time Machine Mk. IV. It's better than its predecessor in almost every way I can imagine. There are still some minor bugs and kinks but I am super satisfied with how it turned out. It's got a cyberpunk themed design and motorsport-inspired livery.

# THE JUICY STUFF:
-   PROCESSOR: nRF52832 Soc. 64MHz ARM cortex M4 with 64k RAM and 512k flash.
-   FIRMWARE: Espruino JS interpreter + JS code. I'm working on a C/C++ version.
-   POWER: CR2032 coin cell battery. Guesstimated battery life of around a month.
-   DISPLAY: Dual 7-segment LEDs with five auxiliary LEDs.
-   INPUT: Triple momentary tactile switches.
-   SOUND: Mini piezo speaker.
-   DIMENSIONS: 43.18mm width and length, 9.2mm thickness(1mm thinner than the Mark IV!).
-   STRAP: 22mm NATO strap.
